        <h2>Description of Dish</h2>
        <p>A protein-rich lunch for everyone to enjoy! Just like my <a href="./protein_waffles.html" target="_blank">protein waffle breakfast</a>, this meal is something that I could eating
        every single day of the week! It's quite filling, obviously macro-friendly and most importantly super delicious! (Plus, pasta!)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients Needed:</h2></center>
