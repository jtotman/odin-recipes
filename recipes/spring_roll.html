        <h2>Description of Dish</h2>
        <p>This is what I've been typically eating for dinners as of late. My mother introduced me to the original recipe, and I have since made my own variation!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients Needed:</h2></center>
    <ul>
        <li>1b ground meat of your choice (I prefer chicken)</li>
        <li>A slaw mix of your choice (I use broccoli slaw)</li>
        <li>1 cup rice of your choice (I use fragrant jasmine rice)</li>
        <li>4 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (adjust to taste as needed)</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder (adjust to taste as needed)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground ginger (adjust to taste as needed)</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 tbsp red pepper flakes (adjust to taste as needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 cups of water to boil. Salt, add 1 cup rice then let simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                <li>- Remove from heat and let sit with lid on until dish is finished.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a high-rimmed saucepan on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add ground meat of choice. Break up/crumble and ensure all meat cooks fully & evenly.</li>
        <li>Once meat is finished cooking, stir in slaw mix. Cover and let steam for 2 mins.</li>
        <li>After steaming is done, stir in soy sauce, garlic powder and ground ginger. Ensure meat and slaw mixture is evenly flavoured.</li>
